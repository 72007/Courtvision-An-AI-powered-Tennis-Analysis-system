CourtVision: An AI-Powered Tennis Analysis System ðŸŽ¾ðŸ¤–

CourtVision is an advanced AI-powered Tennis Analysis System that leverages state-of-the-art deep learning models to provide real-time performance analytics for players, coaches, and broadcasters.
This project was developed as part of the 2025 International Conference on AI in Sports Analytics (ICAISA) research initiative.

FEATURES:

High-speed real-time object detection using YOLOv5

Keypoint extraction using OpenPose / MediaPipe for biomechanics analysis

Deep learning model implementation in PyTorch

92% Average Precision (AP) on player and ball detection

< 5 cm mean error in biomechanics analysis

30 FPS real-time video processing

Supports Performance Analysis, Injury Prevention, and Broadcast Enhancements

HOW IT WORKS:

Video Input: Multi-camera video capture of tennis matches.

Object Detection: YOLO detects players, tennis balls, court lines in real-time.

Keypoint Extraction: OpenPose/MediaPipe extract player biomechanics (joint angles, movement efficiency).

Deep Learning Models: PyTorch models analyze swing velocity, footwork, shot accuracy.

Output: Actionable feedback displayed in real-time for coaching and performance optimization.

RESEARCH BACKGROUND:

Uses insights from AI in sports analytics literature:

YOLOv3, YOLOv5 object detection (Redmon et al.)

OpenPose for human posture detection (Cao et al.)

Deep learning frameworks for sports analysis (Paszke et al.)

Motion recognition and biomechanics analysis (Liu et al., Host et al.)

Targeted at bridging the gap between sports science and AI-based coaching tools.
