## How It Works

1. **Video Input**: Multi-camera video capture of tennis matches.  
2. **Object Detection**: YOLO detects players, tennis balls, court lines in real-time.  
3. **Keypoint Extraction**: OpenPose/MediaPipe extract player biomechanics (joint angles, movement efficiency).  
4. **Deep Learning Models**: PyTorch models analyze swing velocity, footwork, shot accuracy.  
5. **Output**: Actionable feedback displayed in real-time for coaching and performance optimization.

##  Research Background

- Uses insights from **AI in sports analytics** literature:
  - YOLOv3, YOLOv5 object detection [Redmon et al.][1]
  - OpenPose for human posture detection [Cao et al.][2]
  - Deep learning frameworks for sports analysis [Paszke et al.][4]
  - Motion recognition and biomechanics analysis [Liu et al.][3], [Host et al.][7]
- Targeted at bridging the gap between **sports science** and **AI-based coaching tools**.
